FairShuffle - Fairly shuffle a list of elements, using unpredictable
but fair and verifiable values from the Bitcoin blockchain.
========================

This program utilizes the unpredictability of the Bitcoin blockchain
hash to fairly sort a list of items into a easily verified
pseudo-random order.

This guarantees every time the latest Bitcoin blockchain block is
generated, the list is ordered into a new unpredictable order.

Useful for lists of websites, people, list of donators etc... without
giving them unfair advantage for by being on top of the list.
Any interested indenpendant party can verify that the list was ordered
fairly by inspecting which blockchain generated the list.

As Bitcoin blockchain is generated every ~10 minutes, list can be
shuffled once every ~10 minutes, which is useful for caching and not
having to process the list every page view.
